#Another UI Guy articles

I hate managing a blog, so I write for the sake of writing. Some of these articles will be posted in other blogs and some may not. If you happen across this repo and find value in my ramblings, AWESOME! 

While this content for the most part is open source, after all it is on Github, I ask that you please don't steal my thoughts. These writings are being put out for the greater wellbeing of the community.

Thanks
