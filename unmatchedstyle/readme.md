#Sass articles
In efforts to spread the word about using Sass I present to you my general ramblings. I do hope you enjoy. Starting out I am addressing how to get started with Sass. Install and basic concepts. As ideas for more, meater articles, pop into my head I will post them here as well. Concepts like, how to best organize your Sass files, how to build rock solid Mixins, best way to use Extends, Sass Script, etc ...

And don't forget about additional content being posted on the interwebs like [SassCast](http://sasscast.tumblr.com/) and our [Google+](http://goo.gl/S2rTz) page too!

While this content for the most part is open source, after all it is on Github, I ask that you please don't steal my thoughts. These writings are being put out for the greater wellbeing of the community.
