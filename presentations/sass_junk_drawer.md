#Clean out your Sass junk drawer
__*CSS has had a long and sorted past. With every project, it's creator sets never sets out with the goal of making a complete and total mess of things. Their intention is not to make a document that is practically illegible, impracticable to maintain and is limited in scale. But somehow, someway this is where many inevitably end up. What's sad is that even with tools like Sass at our disposal we still end up in the same place, via a different path. Luckily, all is not lost. With some simple strategies, organizational methods and out of the box tools can really help get that junk drawer inline.*__ 

Then we found Sass. A new and amazing language that allows us to break these endless insane documents into smaller, more maintainable documents. Nirvana, right? But sadly our old habits are being carried forward. Whereas we have left the unmaintainable style sheet behind, in it's stead we have created a new folder, a junk drawer if you will, of Sass files void of real organization, haphazardly intertwined to with each other.
