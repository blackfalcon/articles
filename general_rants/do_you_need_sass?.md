#Do you need Sass?
__*[Draft Episode 15: Why Sass?](http://goo.gl/ecdav)* raises a very interesting question. "Do you really *have* to use Sass?"__

For the most part, __no__ you don't __need__ Sass to get work done. The internet has been around for a long time and CSS was here WAY before Sass and people were able to get work done. 

But you can have the same argument for any development languages, innovation or advancement. Do we *need* Python, Ruby, .NET, Clojure, Node or Dart? After all we have C++, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Java and Javascript. Do we need new languages to do the same things? But the argument there is, are we really doing the same things?  

##Innovation pushes us all forward
In the internet age, computer languages have started moving at a pace unparalleled by any other time in computing history. Why? It's an easy assumption to say that more people are involved in solving the problem. You can also say that there are more people pooling together with amazing talents to solve unique issues. But I see that as only part of the answer.

I think back to the early 90s when I started designing/developing web sites. I think of the primitive tools we used, the code patterns we clung too and antiquated languages we coded in. All of involved wanted to make things better and be more efficient at our jobs. 

##Do __we__ need Sass?
__Yes!__ I profoundly say that __we__ as a community of modern web developers __need__ Sass. We need Sass from the perspective that it is pushing the conversation forward as how we write code. Sure there is the W3C, and the Webkit team for the most part, that is coming up with specifications and new CSS features, but the way that code is written, edited and managed is not really being rethought. Sass challenges that thought.
 
Out of all the amazing internet programming languages that have surfaced over the years, the one annoying constant is that we are still using HTML and CSS for the presentation of our applications. 

##Who really writes HTML?
But then I'd even argue that we aren't really using HTML. Most of us, if you know it or not, are basically using HTML pre-processors. PHP, Ruby, .NET or Javascript for that matter, these presentation languages all process down and deliver HTML to the browser. We need this power so that we can efficiently reuse presentation code. Headers, footers, navigation, etc. all using techniques so that we don't have to duplicate code and god forbid have to make a site side update.
