#Do you need Sass?
__*[Draft Episode 15: Why Sass?](http://goo.gl/ecdav)* raises a very interesting question. "Do you really *have* to use Sass?"__

For the most part, __no__ you don't __need__ Sass to get work done. The internet has been around for a long time and CSS was here WAY before Sass and people were able to get work done. 

But you can have the same argument for any development languages, innovations or advancements. Do we *need* Python, Ruby, .NET, Clojure, Node or Dart? After all we have C++, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Java and Javascript. Do we need new languages to do the same things? But the argument there is, are we really doing the same things?  

##Innovation pushes us all forward
In the internet age, computer languages have started moving at a pace unparalleled by any other time in computing history. Why? It's an easy assumption to say that more people are involved in solving the problem. You can also say that there are more people pooling together with amazing talents to solve unique issues. And then there is the old proverb, *"Necessity is the mother of invention."* 

At times I think back to the early 90s when I started designing/developing web sites. I think of the primitive tools used, the code patterns we clung too and antiquated languages we coded with. We aspired to make things better and become more efficient at our jobs. We began to crate processes, identify shortcomings and engineer newer and better solutions. In short, we innovated. 

##Who really writes HTML?
Browsers still require basically the same HTML and CSS that we were given in the early 90s. These core languages to the web have seen little in in the way of major revisions. Short of making a quick demo, who really writes HTML anymore? As soon as the shit gets real, it's not HTML anymore. There is HTML'ish syntax in the presentation you are developing, but it's not strictly HTML anymore. 

HTML has given way to [templating languages](http://goo.gl/BymYX) and there are a lot of them. Every primary development language has it's own flavor of tempting HTML. And yet, there was never the issue raised if we needed these or not, it was simply excepted. 

##Forbidden territory
Why is CSS perceived as special? After all, there is nothing special about the language that precludes itself from the HTML templating argument. While we are required to produce static CSS, there is no law that states that we must write all our code this way. And I would argue that the requirement for static CSS is a moving target as well. 

I decree this notion that *CSS is off limits* is __false__.

##Do __we__ need Sass?
__Yes!__ I profoundly say that __we__ as a community of modern web developers __need Sass__. We need Sass from the perspective that it is pushing the conversation forward as to how we write code. Sure there is the W3C for maintaining standards and then Webkit pushing the boundaries on features, but the way CSS is written, edited and managed is not really being rethought. Sass challenges that thought.

##We need a modern CSS
Web sites and apps have come a long way in the internet's short lifespan. While engineering HTML has been minimized by it's grand number of templating languages, before Sass there was nothing to help us with CSS. Stylesheet documents continue to grow in size, increasing pressure on maintainability and scaleability. CSS in it's current spec does not provide any solutions for manipulating, modularizing or maintaining code. 

Sass is part of a family of languages that innovate and push for evolution. Sass is written not by spec creators or boards that 'discuss' what needs to happen. Sass is written by talented developers that USE CSS and understand it's shortcomings. Sass is engineered by people who don't intend to replace CSS, but make it useable in today's development environment.
