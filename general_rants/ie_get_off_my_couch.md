#Sorry IE, but get off my couch

Did you have this experience too? In collage did you have one of those roommates that was, you know, kind of a bum? Ok, a total bum. Didn't have a job, couldn't make rent, rarely went to class, etc... But your roommate was fun to be around, filled a small void in your life and seemed to have this special quality that you just couldn't put your finger on. 

Then one day when out with some other friends, you started to see all the faults in your roommate. You saw other roommates that embodied all the qualities that you wish your roommate had. You started to see qualities that actually added value to your life. You now see that the qualities that appeared to make your roommate tolerable were actually the product of your doing. If you stopped, would the rest of the world actually see your roommate for whom they really were?

This is my relationship with IE. 

For years we have been lead to believe that IE is more then what it really is. IE is that bum that will not get off your couch, so you do what you can to make it work. We have spent years, uncountable man hours and I shudder to think of the millions of dollars wasted making IE tolerable. To what end? To what benefit? All we have done is prolong the existance of a monkey on our back. It causes my sould to cry when we embark on a new project and I hear someone say, "What is our IE6 plan?" Really? IE6 was given to us more then 10 years ago, why is this still a topic of concern?

I will tell you why. We as developers have let our ability to be clever outwhit ourselves in the end. To all the JS and CSS developers out in the world who have spend time, energy and talent on finding ways to make the internet suck less on IE6 I applaud you and curse you at the same time. 

Like that roomate who would not get off my couch, there was a reality that we were hidding from the rest of the world. Yes, some will say that there were mega coportations out there who are 'unable' to upgrade their browsers because there is so much legacy software tied to a specific version of a browser. To this I say bollocks!
