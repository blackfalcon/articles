#A Designer in a Developer's World

__*Having been a designer and transitioning into a coder via UI development, I have always had a fondness, or obsession if you will, for making the relationships between developers and designers better. Each side desperately seeking their identity in an overlapping world, with their own processes and solutions. But having learned the principles of agile development, I see huge wins to be gained. Design isn't just for designers.*__

Agile is changing the way we do business. I did a huge spec doc once. Once. Never to be repeated. I won't go into all the details about how agile works, I just want to focus on the lean agile concept of *just in time*.

It's a great concept. One that has been [used in the manufacturing world](http://goo.gl/C0xy4) for years. And when it comes to app development this beats the hell out of the old *waterfall* days. But there is a catch. Even in the manufacturing world, all the materials needed just don't magically appear. These materials need to come from somewhere. So, where does agile really begin? 

Savvy development teams will make use of or create reusable frameworks from which they can bootstrap or springboard new projects. Starting from scratch is time consuming and cumbersome. After all, the concept of Agile was initially embraced by developers so these working environments make sense. For them, Iteration 1 means they can get to work and begin delivering value right away.

With design, it's not that simple. Sure there are some template design patterns and inspirational resources out there, and then some open source icons, artifacts, etc., but any designer worth his or her salt will want to design new interactions, visual experiences, elements and artifacts from scratch. Pulling from their inner professional design skills. This is necessary if you want your product to be visually compelling, competitive and potentially a game changer.

Many creative teams struggle with *[Fitting Big-Picture UX Into Agile Development](http://goo.gl/gGmiA)*. Practices like *iteration 0* and even *[iteration -1](http://goo.gl/qgHGk)* have emerged, each met with limited success. The principal problem I feel designers have with concepts like *just in time* is that this is NOT how they have historically worked. Arguments persist for *[Big Design Up Front](http://goo.gl/nsyhB)*, where designers have been known to spend days and even weeks among themselves, chipping away at interactions and aesthetics. Reviewing, tweaking, adjusting and perfecting, all in anticipation of the big unveiling. This process has proven to come at a great cost. Costs like time and billable hours are the easy ones, but what about the cost of not involving others on the team? Where was the *business* in this process? What about the developers? 

##The UI Developer
New people are needed to solve new problems. Let's face it, app UI is a complicated beast. History states that an app developer would also assume the role of developing the UI. Many are waking up to the idea that this is a discipline of it's own. Browsers, platforms, and devices all growing at a mind boggling rate. Performance factors, responsive, adaptive, progressive, unique problems that require their own special attention. 

So, who is a *UI Developer*? Developers who may have come from a design background and found themselves writing code more-so than pushing pixels. Developers that typically specialize in HTML and CSS/Sass, get into interaction based JavaScript and may get into an application language. For years business managers have either been saying or have been told that they need [designers that can code](http://goo.gl/50arY). Some responded to this calling and for others it simply was work to be done. Best friends of the designers and strong allies to the developers, they are well equip to fill a new gap in agile app development.

UI Developers fill unique roles in today's changing development environment. They are not simply HTML and CSS coders. These are people who care deeply about the architecture of these languages, their role in app development and their performance. They are not designers and they are not application engineers. They straddle this middle-ground of passions and responsibilities. Responsible to the design team, they execute in a manner that is easy to follow, maintainable and scalable.

UI Developers will employ solutions like [living style guides](http://goo.gl/f5xgn) and/or code documenting standards, [kss](http://goo.gl/NwFrZ) for example, so that others on the team will have clear instructions how to continue UI development. These are important investments to the stability and scalability of the project. Artifacts and relevant documentation that are *just in time* in accordance with the work being done. 

##Design Teams, Your Future is Before You
There are those who don't like where the winds of change are blowing. There is a looming aspect that threatens their way of life. In some ways I sympathize, in others, I say evolve or die. 

For many, there is nothing to worry about. Your identity as a designer is not being threatened …but it is your deliverable that needs to be rethought. You are better suited for creating and owning the brand, creating “the new aesthetic” and engineering the very foundation that all future designs will springboard from. It is important that someone maintain the core spirit of the design. You are needed most in creating the guidelines and documenting their uses. This role is important, without it designs go astray, consistency is lost and the true vision becomes clouded.

This new creative leadership role is not a haven for divas. There are no ivory towers and there are no exclusive rights to the visual creative experience. If you feel that your role as a designer is to be the visual benevolent dictator, I am afraid that there is a revolution in your future. You need to look at ways to get *more* people involved in the creative process, and that does not mean to simply invite them to meetings where you show 'your' designs. It means to include them early on and allow them to provide real input. Allowing others to make creative decisions and not be afraid to do so. Work with your designers and developers to set good standards, but make sure not to be overbearing. There is nothing more disheartening than being given the illusion of choice.

Now that we have established the core leadership of the design team and redefined their role, we need to look for ways to invent and deploy a new design team. A new insurgency of designers if you will. A team where designers, application and UI developers will work side-by-side in the trenches, in the very moment of the story that is being developed. This new design team will not only create new experiences to honor the core brand, but also be intimate with the restrictions and limitations of the application development. It is all about agile design execution. Creating the *just in time* deliverables that the application and UI developers need to complete the body of work assigned. While these entrenched designers are responsible for staying true to the design guidelines of the creative leadership, their customer is the development team, not the creative team.

##Story Driven Development, Designers in the Trenches 
> *Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!*
*Dr. Peter Venkman*

We've established a few new and somewhat radical concepts here. These ideas will challenge the very foundation of many development and design shops around the world. Most radical is the idea of a distributed design model. Depending on how your design team works today, this may be a hard pill to swallow. Call me crazy, but I see this as a healthy and liberating way of doing work. If your passion is aesthetics, user studies, emotional interactions, establishing and maintaining the brand, then that is what you should do. If your passion lies more in the execution of resources with the creative freedom to design new interactions with clear understanding of the restrictions and limitations of the environment from which your designs will be executed, then that is what you should do. Neither role is to be frowned on or hailed. Each role is part of a team whose goal is to make awesome experiences for their users. But it is this separation of roles that is needed to make this agile *just in time* world work. 

Let's imagine that all the pieces are in place, all the managers are on board. It's time to review stories on the [kanban board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) for deliverables and estimate the effort needed. A senior app developer, a UI developer and one of those embedded designers are included to have a clear evaluation as to what the level of effort is. For UI deliverables, the embedded designer and a UI developer would be responsible to review the work. Depending on the level of the UI work needed this could result in one of three things happening. 

1. The embedded designer sketches out new UI/UX options based on the established style guide and works with a UI developer or app developer to deliver the new UI/UX
1. The UI developer executes a new UI/UX at the direction of the embedded designer
1. The app developer executes the new UI/UX at the direction of the embedded designer following patterns set by the UI developer

Less time spent in graphic applications pre-defining solutions and more time collaborating in real code.

What we have is a distribution of design responsibilities. Design is neither a silo nor [a checkbox in the process](http://goo.gl/vfVbi). Design is a responsibility that can be shared. This is important as I have never seen an org where there are an equal number of designers as there are developers. Think of the increased awesome you will get if you can empower all levels of the development teams to be included in the design process.

When it is all said and done, embedded designers deserve more autonomy to execute and app/UI developers need to be included throughout. Allow everyone to be more creative in their role and in return more successful in their careers.
