#A designer in a developer's world

Having come from a designer's background and transitioning into more of a developer via presentation layer development, I have always had a fondness, or obsession if you will, for making the relationships between developers and designers better. After all, designers are 'right brained' and developers are 'left brained', right?

[Are You a Right-Brained or Left-Brained Designer?](http://goo.gl/LodHH)

##Creative problem solvers
The very idea that developers are solely right brainers comes from some antiquated mental manifestation of '*programmers*' of the 50's. Modern developers are extremely creative individuals. Their output may not be in paintings, charcoal drawings or Photoshop docs, but their output is no less creative. 

The world of app and web development is a crazy new world creating an amazing array of new problems to solve every day, both technologically and creatively. In this new work space we need individuals who are willing to blur the lines of *left* and *right* brained individuals. I guess people I like to call *whole-brained*. Are you *whole-brained*? I think you are. 

##This thing called agile
Agile is changing the way we do business and I can't imagine not doing it this way. I did a huge spec doc once. Once. Never to be repeated. I won't go into all the details about how agile works, I just want to focus on the lean agile concept of *just in time*.

It's a great concept. One that has been used in the manufacturing world for years. And when it comes to development this beats the hell out of the old *waterfall* days. But there is a catch. Even in the manufacturing world, all the materials needed just don't magically appear. These materials need to come from somewhere. So, where does agile really start? With agile app development, this is often a point of contention.  

Smart app/web development teams will either use or create a series of frameworks from which they can bootstrap or springboard new projects. Starting from scratch is time consuming and cumbersome. With design, it's not that simple. Sure there are some template design patterns out there and some really awesome open source icons, artifacts, etc (notice I didn't say clip art, there is no such thing as *good* clip art and you should be ashamed for using it). With a new project any designer worth his or her salt will want to design new interactions, new visual experiences, new elements and artifacts from scratch. Pulling from their inner professional design skills. This is a good thing. If you want your product to be visually compelling, competitive and potentially a game changer, you need this skill. Over time on a project the designer will start to build a catalog of assets that can be used again and again. So while the origin of the starting point may be a little different between designers and developers, I think that the goals are very similar. 

But then again, there is this *just in time* principal I was talking about. This concept is that you don't build things till you need them. In a lot of ways, this makes perfect sense. But in some ways, this is very hard to deliver. Many creative teams struggle with what this means to them. 

##The emergence of the design-gineer
New worlds need new people to solve new problems. We as professionals need to evolve into the new roles that our industry demands of us. Sometimes this means creating new roles and at times this means that we need to combine the skills of others to create something new. 

Let's face it, the UI of modern apps is a complicated beast. Where it was assumed that any developer would assume the role of developing the UI, many shops are waking up to the idea that this is a discipline of it's own. Browser, platform, device and the going array of supporting technologies. Unique problems of their own that require their special attention. 

But what is a *design-gineer*? Front-end devs for the most part. Developers like myself who have come from primarily a design background and found themselves writing code as much as or even more-so then pushing pixels. Developers that typically specialize in HTML and CSS/Sass, get into interaction based JavaScript and typically can go deep in one or two application languages.
